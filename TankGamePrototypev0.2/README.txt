Can you reach the heavens before God smites you down?
Using your limited ammunition and the minerals your tank collects
after excavating the earth, you must build your way towards the sky
in this simple physics game.

Increase your score by mining terrain, reaching new heights, and
doing either of these things while jumping.
Minerals are collected by destroying/lowering the terrain.
Ammunition is generated passively by consuming minerals.

To win: Stay above the goal altitude for 20 seconds. (The timer does not stop!)
You will lose if either the time runs out, or you run out of ammunition and cannot make more!


---CONTROLS---
Escape		Exit Game
Enter		Continues game after loss
Y		Toggle tank/free camera mode
N		Toggle graphics mode between standard and fisheye
[]		Brackets change camera focal length
-=		Minus/Equals change field of view
;'		Semicolon and single quotes change fisheye view intensity
M		Reset the camera to normal


---TANK CONTROLS---
WASD		Move/Turn the Tank
Q/E		Rotates Tank Turret left/right
R/F		Raises/Lowers Tank Gun
Space		Jump
Lshift		Increases your acceleration
Lctrl		Slows movement and rotation (for finer control)
C		Fires a projectile from the tank cannon that modifies the terrain, collecting or spending minerals
1-4		Changes Bullet effect on terrain
		    1: explodes creating small craters
		    2: excavates a medium area of terrain around the impact
		    3: flattens a medium area of terrain to the height of the impact point
		    4: Spends minerals to dump a large amount of material at the impact point, raising the terrain
